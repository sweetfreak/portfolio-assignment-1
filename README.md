## Overview
This website was created in order to showcase my work for interested employers.

## Installation
This HTML file requires a .CSS style sheet. By placing the entire website folder on a server together, it can be uploaded to a server, and the files can be found.

## Features
My name and an avatar/photo of myself upon loading the website, as well as a nav bar linking to other sections of the website including "About Me", "Projects", and "Contact" sections.

The nav bar brings me to other sections of my portfolio.

The "Projects" section in the nav bar brings viewers directly to images of past/current works, and titles of each project, including a featured project.

Clicking on a project image deploys the application linking to the project (or in one case, a placeholder link)

When the viewer views this on smaller screens, the layout is responsive and adapts to the size.
For example, it should look like the following on most mobile phones:
![mobile phone viewport](./assets/images/demoImage.png)
